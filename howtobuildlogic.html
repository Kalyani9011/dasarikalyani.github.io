    <h1>Why and How to learn Python Programming Language?</h1>
    <p>Python is the programming language behind giant applications like YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Uber, Netflix, and many more apps.
    </p>
    <p>But are you still wondering whether or not you should learn it? Should you add it to your knowledge stack?
    </p>
    <p>Direct answer- Yes! Learning it will assure you a great job, a high package, brilliant opportunities, amazing communities, and a successful and fulfilling software development career.
    </p>
    <p>Python is a general-purpose, interpreted high-level software development language developed in 1991, 
        yet recently gained popularity with the 3rd version of Python ( Python 3).</p>
    <p>Let's look at the reasons for the language's popularity and how you can learn Python in the most engaging and practical way.</p>
    <h1>Why was Python developed?</h1>
    <p>Guido van Rossum, a software developer, got frustrated with the complex and tedious languages he was working with. 
        Hence in the 1980s, he picked the project of developing a syntactically beautiful, simple, easy, and fun-to-use language.
         Fun! The name suggests that already.
         But to understand what made Python one of the most loved programming languages continue reading below.</p>
        <h1>Features of Python Language</h1>
        <p>Here are the 5 major reasons that make the Python language so popular with a fan base calling themselves “Pythonistas”.</p>
        <h2>1. Python is beginner-friendly.</h2>
        <p>Python features very closely with the English syntax and is super easy to read even by someone, not a coder.
             It uses fewer lines of code and simple rules with no semicolon at the end of every line or confusing brackets. </p>
        <h2>2. Python is Easy to Learn</h2>
        <p>Python's rules and syntax are very easy compared to other popular languages like C, C++, and Java. Another thing that makes
             Python simple is that it is an interpreted language. Interpreted language means when you write a program in C or C++,
              you write the complete code and then check 
            for errors in the compiler. But with Python, you can check if your code is error-free in every line and correct 
            if it's wrong.</p>
        <h2>3. Python is highly versatile</h2>
        <p>Python can be used for small projects, say making a calculator, and for big and complex tasks such as web development, 
            data analytics, etc.
             This is possible due to the pre-written codes you can use directly and build upon. These pre-written codes
              are called Python libraries and frameworks.
            Once you learn the basics of Python through self-study, a degree, or a course, you'll be able
             to understand a huge amount of code developed by other programmers.</p>
        <h2>4. Python is super flexible</h2>
        <p>Python offers flexibility with the platform it is used upon. You can easily run the Python code you wrote on Windows over
             Linux or macOS without making any changes. Another 
            exciting feature of Python is that it can run along with other programming languages such as Java (Jython) or
             C Language (CPython).</p>
        <h2>5. Free and Open-Source</h2>
        <p>Python is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes. It doesn't cost anything to download Python or to 
            include it in your application. It can also be freely modified and re-distributed.
             You can download Python from the official Python website.</p> <hr style="border: 2px solid rgb(20, 2, 66);">
        <h1>Applications of Python Language</h1>
        <p>With incredible versatility, Python has a wide range of applications. Some major fields where Python language is used are:</p>
        <ul style="font-size: 30px;color:#110447;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Web development (Backend)</li>

        <p>With an ever-growing community of Python users and its versatility and wide applications, 
            it has become the most popular programming language (leaving behind Java and C++). 
            It has got abundant libraries, various frameworks, modules and file extensions.</p>
    
        <p> Here are the top 3 reasons Python is a great place to start and take your coding journey to heights.</p>
        <h1>1. High demand for Python programmers</h1>
        <p>Many companies, including MAANG (Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), are hiring Python developers. 
            It is one of the most lucrative job roles in the IT industry. </p>
        <p>We can sense how self-driving cars, smart homes, robots, and humanoids are the future of technology. 
            Python is the most used language in developing machine learning and AI programs. Python is only going 
            to grow in the coming decade.
        </p>
        <h1>2. Growing communities across the globe.</h1>
        <p>Thousands of supportive and robust online communities are growing that guide and motivate beginners in 
            their journey with Python. They hold discussion forums, meetups, and seminars worldwide for their people to 
            learn and contribute. 
    
            Being an active part of these communities assure great learning and unimaginable opportunities.</p>
        <h1>3. Fastest growing programming language</h1>
        <p>Python has developers worldwide and is used in most projects developed in this fast-changing world. Due to its open-source feature, 
            many enthusiasts keep updating the language, and this adaptability makes it an ever-growing programming language.</p>
