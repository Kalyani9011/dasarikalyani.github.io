            The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years.
            Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security.
            Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one of the main
             factors in its appeal.Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust type system and allows automatic memory management.
             It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its built-in support for multithreading and security features.
             <br> <br>In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use. <br> <br>
             Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to be a widely used language in the 
             software development industry thanks to its popularity and adaptability, which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs
              and developers alike. <br> <br>
               There are many useful classes and functions in Java’s standard library, 
             and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development process while adding even more capability. </p>

   pogramming language after Python. </ul></p>  <hr>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Features of Java</h1>
        
            <p><b style="color: darkgreen; font-size: 33px;">Platform independence:</b> Java is a “write once, run anywhere” language, meaning that Java code can run without any changes on any platform that supports Java.</p>
            <p><b style="color: darkgreen; font-size: 33px;">Object-oriented language:</b> Java is an object-oriented language that enables programmers to create modular, reusable code components known as objects, making it simpler to develop and maintain complex programmes.</p>
            <p> <b style ="color: darkgreen; font-size: 33px;">Automatic memory management:</b> Java includes an automatic memory management mechanism that relieves developers of the need to manually handle memory allocation and deallocation.</p>
            <p><b style="color: darkgreen; font-size: 33px;">Security:</b> Java contains built-in security measures that can block unauthorized access and shield users from potential security risks. Java was created with security in mind.</p>
            <p><b style="color:darkgreen; font-size: 33px;">Rich API:</b> The Java standard library has a sizable number of classes and methods, giving programmers a wide range of practical tools for creating applications.</p>
            <p><b style="color: darkgreen; font-size: 33px;">Multi-threading support:</b> Support for multithreading is integrated into Java, enabling programmers to create concurrent applications that can handle running several threads at once.</p>
            <p><b style="color: darkgreen; font-size: 33px;">High performance:</b> Java is renowned for having a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which optimizes code execution while it is running.</p>
            <p><b style="color: darkgreen; font-size: 33px;">Scalability:</b> Java's modular architecture and object-oriented programming make it simpler to create large-scale programmes that can be scaled up or down based on demand.</p>
            <p><b style="color: darkgreen; font-size: 33px;">Simplified syntax:</b> Java has a syntax that is simpler than other programming languages, 
                making it simpler for developers to write and read code.</p>
        
        <p>Because they enable writing, testing, and deploying software applications simpler, quicker, and more effectively, Java's characteristics are crucial for software development.</p>
        <p>These capabilities enable developers to produce strong, safe, and high-performing programmes that satisfy the requirements of contemporary software development.</p>
